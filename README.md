# sprite-fight
Sprite fight is a DragonBallZ inspired game, with 2 opposing players (user controlled) on opposite sides of the screen.
Players are limited to moving up and down, and can fire projectiles (Kamehamehas) at one another.
Each player starts with 100 HealthPoints (represented by the green bar). Each player will shoot Kamehamehas at each other in a race to get the other player's health to Zero first.
The first player to force the other user to Zero HP wins!
